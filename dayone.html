     <p>
    Environment can be defined as a sum total of all the living and non-living element
    s and their effects that influence human life. While all living or biotic elements are animals
    plants, forests, fisheries, and birds,
    non-living or abiotic elements include water, land, sunlight, rocks, and air.

     <h3>Environment in term of poem</h3>
     <pre style="color:red;"> In realms of green and city's hum,

        The term we speak, a total sum.

        Nature's breath and urban sprawl,

        In every context, it stands tall.
        
        Beneath the skies and oceans wide,

        A dance of life, a rhythmic tide.

        Ecosystems dance, a delicate trance,

        In the natural world, life's true romance

     <h1 id="C4">Chapter 4</h1>
     <blockquote cite="https://www.ecomena.org/inspirational-quotes-environment/" >
Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth… these are one and the same fight.
 We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security and women’s empowerment. 
Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.
