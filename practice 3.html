    <h1 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">COMMON ELEMENT</h1><hr><br>
    <p>
        The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football:<br> carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league,<br> where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown,<br> and kicking codes such as association football and Gaelic football, <br>where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-Douge-10"><small><sup>[10]</sup></small></a></p>
<p>Common rules among the sports include:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-11"><small><sup>[11]</sup></small></a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more<br> per team) are also popular.</li>
    <li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(sport)"><li>Score</li></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sport)"><li>Goal</li></a>or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
     <li>Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalposts">Goalposts</a></li>
     <li>The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.</li>
     <li>Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all codes, common skills include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(sports)">Passing ,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)">Tackle</a>evasion of tackles, catching and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_(football)">Kicking</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-Douge-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
In most codes,<br> there are rules restricting the movement of players <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(sport)">Offside,</a>and players scoring a goal must put the ball either<br> under or over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sport)">Crossbar</a> between Goalposts.

<h1 style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Etymology</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic;">main article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(word)">Football word</a></p>
<p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that the word "football"<br> (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-12"><small><sup>[12]</sup></small></a>
    There is an alternative explanation, which<br> is that football originally referred to a variety of games in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe">Medival Europe</a>that were<br> played on foot.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football#cite_note-13"><small><sup>[13]</sup></small></a> There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.</p>
